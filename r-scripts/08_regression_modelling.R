### develop, test for significance and plot different models of increasing complexity 
#  using  multiple regresssion, assuming a poisson distribution (so use a generalized linear model)
# Explore  how the abundance of Orchestia depends on elevation_m and year,  their potential interaction,
# and a potential ecological optimum of Orchestia with respect to elevation_m
# show the effect of elevation but now in a generalized linear model instead of linear model, using a log link function and a poisson distribution


#add the linear model to the plot
# calculate the predicted value of m2 for every observation, add to the dataset as a variable as pred2
# add the new predicted line to the previous plot p2, store as object p3 and show it



# now test and show  the effect of both elevation , elevation squared and year


#add the linear model to the plot
# calculate the predicted value of m2 for every observation, add to the dataset as a variable as pred2
# add the new predicted line to the previous plot p2, store as object p3 and show it


# better than the previous?


# add the interaction to the model: elevation + elevation ^2 + year + elevation*year
# now test and show  the effect of both elevation + year


#add the  model to the plot
# calculate the predicted value of m2 for every observation, add to the dataset as a variable as pred2
